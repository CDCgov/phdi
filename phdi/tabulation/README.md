# The FHIR Data Tabulation Package

This package contains functions to use a schema (as defined in `phdi.tabulation`) to read data from a FHIR server, and write it to a tabular format. The intent is to extract FHIR resources from a FHIR server, and write into a tabular data structure defined by the schema.
