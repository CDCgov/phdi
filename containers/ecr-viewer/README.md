## Getting Started with DIBBs eCR Viewer

### Introduction

The DIBBs eCR Viewer app offers a REST API for processing eCR FHIR messages into an HTML page with key insights.

### Running eCR Viewer

The eCR Viewer app can be run using Docker (or any other OCI container runtime e.g., Podman), or directly from the Node.js source code.

#### Running with Docker (Recommended)

To run the eCR Viewer app with Docker, follow these steps.

1. Confirm that you have Docker installed by running `docker -v`. If you do not see a response similar to what is shown below, follow [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install Docker.

```
❯ docker -v
Docker version 20.10.21, build baeda1f
```

2. Download a copy of the Docker image from the PHDI repository by running `docker pull ghcr.io/cdcgov/phdi/ecr-viewer:latest`.
3. Run the service with `docker run -p 8080:8080 ecr-viewer:latest`.

Congratulations, the eCR Viewer app should now be running on `localhost:8080`!

#### Running from Node.js Source Code

We recommend running the eCR Viewer app from a container, but if that is not feasible for a given use-case, it may also be run directly from Node using the steps below.

1. Ensure that both Git and Node 18.x or higher are installed.
2. Clone the PHDI repository with `git clone https://github.com/CDCgov/phdi`.
3. Navigate to `/phdi/containers/ecr-viewer/`.
4. Install all of the Node dependencies for the eCR Viewer app with `npm install`.
5. Run the eCR Viewer app on `localhost:3000` with `npm run dev`.

### Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image for the eCR Viewer app from source instead of downloading it from the PHDI repository follow these steps.

1. Ensure that both [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) are installed.
2. Clone the PHDI repository with `git clone https://github.com/CDCgov/phdi`.
3. Navigate to `/phdi/containers/ecr-viewer/`.
4. Run `docker build -t ecr-viewer .`.

### Running via docker-compose

The eCR Viewer requires a Postgres database with FHIR bundles to render properly. To make local development easier, a docker-compose file has been created that starts a Postgres database, seeds it with eCR FHIR data, and starts the Node service. This can be run with `docker compose up`. See the [Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/compose_up/) for additional information.

### Standalone Viewer 

To enable the Standlone viewer homepage, set the environment variable `STANDALONE_VIEWER` to `true`. This will enable the Standalone viewer homepage at `localhost:3000`.

For local development, if `STANDALONE_VIEWER` is not set to `true` on `.env.local`, convert-seed-data will not seed the metadata.

### Updating Seed Data

Occasionally, the FHIR Converter will be updated requiring new seed data to be regenerated. This can be done by running `npm run convert-seed-data`. To load the new data you will have to delete the current volume used by your DB.

### Potential Issues

If you have problems connecting your database run this command to see what other postgres databases are running
`sudo lsof -i :5432`

then kill it
`kill {pid}`
