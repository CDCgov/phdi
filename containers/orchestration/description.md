## Getting Started with the DIBBs Orchestration

### Introduction
The PHDI Orchestration app offers a REST API for processing messages through a series of microservices.

### Running Orchestration

The Orchestration app can be run using Docker (or any other OCI container runtime e.g., Podman), or directly from the Python source code.

### Running Orchestration tests
#### Running Unit Tests
1. `cd containers/orchestration`
2. `eval "$(pyenv init -)"`
3. `source .venv/bin/activate`
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `python -m pytest --cov-report xml --cov=. -m "not integration" tests/`

#### Running Integration Tests
1. `cd containers/orchestration`
2. `eval "$(pyenv init -)"`
3. `source .venv/bin/activate`
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `python -m pytest -m "integration"`

#### Running with Docker (Recommended)

To run the Orchestration app with Docker, follow these steps.
1. Confirm that you have Docker installed by running `docker -v`. If you do not see a response similar to what is shown below, follow [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install Docker.
```
❯ docker -v
Docker version 20.10.21, build baeda1f
``` 
2. Download a copy of the Docker image from the PHDI repository by running `docker pull ghcr.io/cdcgov/phdi/orchestration:latest`.
3. Run the service with ` docker run -p 8080:8080 orchestration:latest`.

Congratulations, the Orchestration app should now be running on `localhost:8080`!

#### Running from Python Source Code

We recommend running the Orchestration app from a container, but if that is not feasible for a given use-case, it may also be run directly from Python using the steps below.

1. Ensure that both Git and Python 3.10 or higher are installed.
2. Clone the PHDI repository with `git clone https://github.com/CDCgov/phdi`.
3. Navigate to `/phdi/containers/orchestration/`.
4. Make a fresh virtual environment with `python -m venv .venv`.
5. Activate the virtual environment with `source .venv/bin/activate` (MacOS and Linux), `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows Command Prompt), or `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` (Windows Power Shell).
5. Install all of the Python dependencies for the Orchestration app with `pip install -r requirements.txt` into your virtual environment.
6. Run the Orchestration app on `localhost:8080` with `python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080`. 

### Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image for the Orchestration app from source instead of downloading it from the PHDI repository follow these steps.
1. Ensure that both [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) are installed.
2. Clone the PHDI repository with `git clone https://github.com/CDCgov/phdi`.
3. Navigate to `/phdi/containers/orchestration/`.
4. Run `docker build -t orchestration .`.

### The API 

When viewing these docs from the `/redoc` endpoint on a running instance of the Orchestration app or the PHDI website, detailed documentation on the API will be available below. 

### Running the /process-zip endpoint
When processing an ecr .zip file through the Orchestration app, call the `/process-zip` endpoint to run the file. 

The endpoint will be a POST call to the `/process-zip` endpoint with the following parameters in the form body

- `message_type`: The type of stream of the uploaded file's underlying data (e.g. ecr, elr, etc.). If the data is in FHIR format, set to FHIR.
- `include_error_types`: The type of errors to return (e.g. warnings, errors, fatal).
- `data_type`: The type of data held in the uploaded file. Eligible values include `ecr`, `zip`, `fhir`, and `hl7`. In most cases it will be zip
- `config_file_name`: The name of the configuration file to load on the service's back-end, specifying the workflow to apply. These are uploaded by the organization hosting the application. There are samples of these files in the /assets folder of this application
- `upload_file`: A file containing clinical health care information. 

An an example of calling this endpoint would look like this 

```
curl --location 'https://your_url_here/orchestration/process-zip' \
--form 'message_type="ecr"' \
--form 'include_error_types="[errors]"' \
--form 'config_file_name="sample-orchestration-s3-config.json"' \
--form 'upload_file=@"/path_to_your_zip/sample.zip"' \
--form 'data_type="zip"'
```

The output will vary depending on the type of configuration chosen. However, the process will have status `200` indicating it did not encounter errors when running the Orchestration app.
