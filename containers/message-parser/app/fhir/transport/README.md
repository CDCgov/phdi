This package contains functions used to interact with a FHIR server. Utilities used to interact with the core [FHIR API](https://hl7.org/fhir/http.html) are contained in the `app.fhir.transport.http` module.

## Provenance

> #TODO: add more info about no longer using the `phdi` package; some central `.md` file with a summary and what that meaning for development moving forward.

Originally this code was from the `phdi` package maintained at the root directory of this repository at `phdi`. See [documentation that communicates above TODO] for more information.
