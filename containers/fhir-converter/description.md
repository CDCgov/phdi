## Getting Started with the PHDI FHIR Converter

### Introduction
The PHDI FHIR Converter offers a containerized web services that exposes an HTTP endpoint for converting Hl7v2, CCD, and STU3 data to FHIR R4. Detailed documentation on the `/convert-to-fhir` endpoint is available [here](#the-convert-to-fhir-endpoint)

### Running the FHIR Converter

The FHIR Converter can be run using Docker (or any other OCI container runtime e.g. Podman), or directly from the Python sorce code.

#### Running with Docker (Recommended)

To run the FHIR Converter with Docker follow these steps.
1. Confirm that you have Docker installed by running `docker -v`. If you do not see a response similar what is shown below, follow [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install Docker.
```
‚ùØ docker -v
Docker version 20.10.21, build baeda1f
``` 
2. Download a copy of the Docker image from the PHDI repository by running `docker pull ghcr.io/cdcgov/phdi/fhir-converter:main`.
3. Run the service with `docker run -p 8080:8080 fhir-converter`.

Congradulations the FHIR Converter should now be running on `localhost:8080`!

#### Running from Python Source Code

We recommend running the FHIR Converter from a container, but if that is not feasible for a given use-case, it may also be run directly from Python using the steps below.

1. Ensure that both Git and Python 3.10 or higher are installed.
2. Clone the PHDI repository with `git clone https://github.com/CDCgov/phdi`.
3. Navigate to `/phdi/containers/fhir-converter/`.
4. Install all of the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. We recommend that you do this in Python virtual environment.
5. Run the FHIR Converter on `localhost:8080` with `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080`. 

### Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image for the FHIR Converter from source instead of downloading it from the PHDI repository follow these steps.
1. Ensure that bother Git and Docker are installed.
2. Clone the PHDI repository with `git clone https://github.com/CDCgov/phdi`.
3. Navigate to `/phdi/containers/fhir-converter/`.
4. Run `docker build -t fhir-converter .`
