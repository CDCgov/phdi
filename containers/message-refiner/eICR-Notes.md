# eICR Specification Notes (CDA-phcaserpt-1.1.1)

The purpose of this documentation is to focus on the contents of the `<structuredBody>` and how the various section-level and entry-level components are composed to create the body of an eICR document.

## Section-level vs entry-level components

In volume 2 of the CDA-phcaserpt-1.1.1 specification there are tables that explain the hierarchical relationship that comprises an eICR document. There are specific blocks of elements that are named and these names have associated metadata that both signal and connect them to other nested named blocks of elements. You can think of these named blocks of elements almost like classes in object oriented programming but without inheritance in a strict sense. Rather than inheritance they signal the hierarchical relationship between the named block of elements. Each named block of elements is governed by a template that describes what metadata it must, should, or may contain as well as the order of these metadata.

> the `root` value of a `templateId`, which is an OID, is the _best_ way to find a specific named block of elements within a CDA broadly and eICR specifically. Every single named block of elements has a unique `templateId` that can be queried via XPath.

Section-level templates are higher up the hierarchy while entry-level templates are children of section-level templates. Some sections are **required** in order for an eICR document to be valid based on the associated schematron found on the spcification's [GitHub repositry](https://github.com/HL7/CDA-phcaserpt-1.1.1/tree/main/validation). Every single template has a unique id that is used to track and test each row of a template; these rules are called conf numbers (`CONF#`). When validating an eICR document against the schematron the messages coming back are based on the `CONF#` and whether or not this is a fatal error, an error, or a warning. Our goal in this work is to not introduce additional errors or warnings given that the eICR messages have likely already undergone validation on the AIMS platform.

Additionally there are some section-level templates that have templates for both:

- Entries optional, and;
- Entries required

These signifiers do not necessarily mean that a section **must** be present in order for a message to be valid. For example, the Immunizations Section can be completely removed from an eICR document without affecting the schematron validation process whereas doing the same thing to the Encounters Section would result in an error.

This might seem confusing, but the "entries required" vs "entries optional" deal with what is required by that specific `templateId`. One template does not require an `<entry>` (optional says `<entry>` _should_ be there but required says that it _shall_ be there).

## Trigger Code Templates

### Manually triggered

#### Section-level and entry-level components

| Parent Section          | LOINC code |
| ----------------------- | ---------- |
| Encounters Section (V3) | 46240-8    |

- Encounters Section (V3) `<section>` ➡️ `<entry>`
  - Encounter Activity (V3) `<encounter>` ➡️ `<entryRelationship>`
    - Encounter Diagnosis (V3) `<act>` ➡️ `<entryRelationship>`
      - Problem Observation (V3) `<observation>` ➡️ `<entryRelationship>`
      - **Initial Case Report Manual Initiation Reason Observation `<observation>` ➡️ `<entryRelationship>`**

Manually triggered eICRs have the following `templateId`:

- `2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.15.2.3.5`

You can see an example of this being used below in the Problem Observation (V3). The `templateId`'s `root` attribute contains the above OID as its value.

#### Example from the sample files that ship with the spec:

```xml
<entryRelationship typeCode="COMP">

  </observation>
</entryRelationship>
```

#### How to return

This will depend on the `typeCode` of the `<entryRelationship>` element. In the example above we have nested `<entryRelationship>` tags with a `typeCode="SUBJ"`, which means that as you continue to navigate towards the last child `<entryRelationship>` tag you end up with the subject (`SUBJ`) of the `<entry>`. This means that there may need to be either some cleaning out of additional `<entryRelationship>` blocks that are merely referenced (`REFE`) or a part of/component of (`COMP`) and `<entry>` rather than the main reason for the data.

```xml
<entry>
  <encounter>
    <entryRelationship>
      <act>
        <entryRelationship>
          <observation>
            Data we want
          </observation>
        </entryRelationship>
      </act>
    </entryRelationship>
  </encounter>
</entry>
```

    - **Initial Case Report Trigger Code Result Observation `<observation>`**

Result observation triggered eICRs have the following `templateId`:

- `2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.15.2.3.2`

You can see an example of this being used below in the Result Observation (V3). The `templateId`'s `root` attribute contains the above OID as its value.

#### Example from the sample files that ship with the spec:

```xml
<component>
  <!-- This observation is a trigger code preliminary result observation -
        both the code and value are trigger codes and thus
        both the code and the value must contain @sdtc:valueSet and @sdtc:valueSetVersion.
        Preliminary result is indicated by statusCode="active" -->

  </observation>
</component>
```

#### How to return

This `<entry>` **must** contain what is called a "results organizer", which is the `<organizer>` child immediately after the `<entry>`. The trigger code `<observation>` is then wrapped in a `<component>` as a child of `<organizer>`.

```xml
<entry>
  <organizer>
    <component>
      <observation>
        Data we want
      </observation>
    </component>
  </organizer>
</entry>
```
