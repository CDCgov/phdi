## Getting Started with the PHDI validation Service

### Introduction
The PHDI validation service offers a REST API for validating healthcare messages

### Running the Validation Service

The validation service can be run using Docker (or any other OCI container runtime e.g. Podman), or directly from the Python sorce code.

#### Running with Docker (Recommended)

To run the validation service with Docker follow these steps.
1. Confirm that you have Docker installed by running `docker -v`. If you do not see a response similar what is shown below, follow [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install Docker.
```
‚ùØ docker -v
Docker version 20.10.21, build baeda1f
``` 
2. Download a copy of the Docker image from the PHDI repository by running `docker pull ghcr.io/cdcgov/phdi/validation:main`.
3. Run the service with ` docker run -p 8080:8080 validation:main`.

Congradulations the FHIR Converter should now be running on `localhost:8080`!

#### Running from Python Source Code

We recommend running the validation service from a container, but if that is not feasible for a given use-case, it may also be run directly from Python using the steps below.

1. Ensure that both Git and Python 3.10 or higher are installed.
2. Clone the PHDI repository with `git clone https://github.com/CDCgov/phdi`.
3. Navigate to `/phdi/containers/validation/`.
4. Make a fresh virtual environment with `python -m venv .venv`.
5. Activate the virtual environement with `source .venv/bin/activate` (MacOS and Linux), `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows Command Prompt), or `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` (Windows Power Shell).
5. Install all of the Python dependencies for the validation service with `pip install -r requirements.txt` into your virtual environment.
6. Run the FHIR Converter on `localhost:8080` with `python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080`. 

### Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image for the validation service from source instead of downloading it from the PHDI repository follow these steps.
1. Ensure that both [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) are installed.
2. Clone the PHDI repository with `git clone https://github.com/CDCgov/phdi`.
3. Navigate to `/phdi/containers/validation/`.
4. Run `docker build -t validation .`.

### The API 

When viewing these docs from the `/redoc` endpoint on a running instance of the validation service or the the PHDI website detailed documentation on the API will be avaiable below.
