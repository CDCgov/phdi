# The Transport Package

This package contains general data transport functions. Currently, this module contains a function to perform an HTTP request with retry logic, which is available in the `app.transport.http` module.

## Provenance

> #TODO: add more info about no longer using the `phdi` package; some central `.md` file with a summary and what that meaning for development moving forward.

Originally this code was from the `phdi` package maintained at the root directory of this repository at `phdi`. See [documentation that communicates above TODO] for more information.
