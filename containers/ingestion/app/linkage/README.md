# The Linkage Package

This package contains functions useful to link two records together via identifying information. It uses information such as name, DOB, and address with a hash generator to determine if two records are referencing the same patient.

## Provenance

> #TODO: add more info about no longer using the `phdi` package; some central `.md` file with a summary and what that meaning for development moving forward.

Originally this code was from the `phdi` package maintained at the root directory of this repository at `phdi`. See [documentation that communicates above TODO] for more information.
