        "To run this notebook, you'll need to configure your system to recognize the R kernel. A simple tutorial can be found here: https://irkernel.github.io/installation/. To start, make sure you've installed the latest version of R, available from the CRAN repository at https://cloud.r-project.org/index.html. Then, launch R from the terminal with the `R` command. **Important:** We strongly recommend installing R from CRAN and performing the next step with R launched from your terminal. This is because the R executable libraries install in different places on your computer  depending on whether you installed R from CRAN, the R app / RStudio, or a package manager like homebrew, which can make make modifying the `PATH` environment variable complicated. Performing the next step using a terminal-launched R will install all of the relevant frameworks and executables in the same place without authorization issues. Run `install.packages('IRkernel')`, then run `IRkernel::installspec()`. That's it! Your notebook software can now \"see\" the R kernel on your machine."
