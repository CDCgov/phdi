    "This notebook provides a tutorial on how to use functionality from the PHDI_building_blocks library to achieve the following:\n",
    "1. Read a user-defined schema config file that specifies one or more tables.\n",
    "2. Query a FHIR server to extract the data specified in the schema.\n",
    "3. Transform the data into a structured format.\n",
    "4. Load the data into one of the supported persistent tabular file formats.\n",
    "5. Print a summary of the tables that were created.\n",

    "1. A simple example schema config file called `example_schema.yaml`.\n",
    "2. A `requirements.txt` file that can be used to install the `PHDI_building_blocks` library in your Python environment by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.\n"

    "- **schema_path**: The path to a schema config file. We have provided a simple example of a schema config file in this directory called \"example_schema.yaml\". Currently only YAML files are supported, but support for JSON will be added in the future.\n",
    "- **output_path**: The path to the directory where the tables will be written. If this directory does not exist it will be created. We have set this by default to your current directory.\n",
    "- **output_format**: The format of the files that the tables will be written to. Currently only parquet is supported. Support for CSV is in development and other tabular persistent formats will be supported in the future.\n",
    "- **fhir_url**: The URL of the FHIR server you wish to extract data from.\n",
